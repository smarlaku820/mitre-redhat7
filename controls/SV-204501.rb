Note: GRUB 2 reads its configuration from the "/boot/grub2/grub.cfg" file on traditional BIOS-based machines and from the "/boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg" file on UEFI machines.

Check for the existence of alternate boot loader configuration files with the following command:

# find / -name grub.cfg
/boot/grub2/grub.cfg

If a "grub.cfg" is found in any subdirectories other than "/boot/grub2" and "/boot/efi/EFI/redhat", ask the System Administrator if there is documentation signed by the ISSO to approve the use of removable media as a boot loader.

Check that the grub configuration file has the set root command in each menu entry with the following commands:

# grep -cw menuentry /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
1
# grep 'set root' /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
set root=(hd0,1)

If the system is using an alternate boot loader on removable media, and documentation does not exist approving the alternate configuration, this is a finding.)
